Team 6039, PiRobotics is an FRC team founded in 2016.  They preside at Stevenson School in Pebble Beach California.  New to the game, they are eager to climb the ranks.  A small passionate team is the secret to their early success.  In their very first competition, the San Jose Regionals (2016), they took 9th, moving into the quarterfinals.  This huge success for a rookie team sets the bar high for the coming years, but the team is ready and eager to take any and all new challenges that come their way.
